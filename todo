Conjugations:
Figure out how to format response: right now i think it makes sense to make it arbitrarily sized matrices
    these arbitrary matrices will have associated meta data that will be diplayed in anki
    to do this:
        1. determine how to count number of matrices
        2. convert json's containing the conugations to dataframes and then use .to_html (add tense and conditional and lines)
        4. consider finding a way to prioritize them
Other:
choose between figuring out espeak, keep trying reverse, or somehow integrate the mac add on
figure out if reverso will distill a word down to its base form to use that as the main card?
can at least get conjugation, aspect, and base form for verbs from conjugation endpoint by scraping
get all grammar data
get conjugations/full case endings (add as a picture to conjugation field)

implement crawling main that takes in my file and slowly starts uploading to anki

long term -
setup this to run permanently as a RESTFul API on rpi that we can ping from a translation shortcut on our phones to get a quick translation and create fully featured card
needs a switch user ability (already built in to anki connect) so that I can change between mine and maggie's accounts on the anki client which has to be open always on the rpi
some way to make the whole thing audio based? reverse engineer the api that provides Ankiweb with my responses?
